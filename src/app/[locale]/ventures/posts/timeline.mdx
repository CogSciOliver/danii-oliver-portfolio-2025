Event: Meet & Greet Fundraiser & Luncheon for Brian A. Cunningham
Venue: Taproom 642, Brooklyn, NY
Date: 2017 (NYC Council District 40 Campaign)

Overview:
As part of my commitment to supporting local leadership and community-driven initiatives, I hosted a meet-and-greet fundraiser and luncheon for Brian A. Cunningham during his 2017 campaign for the NYC Council District 40 seat. The event provided a welcoming space for community members to connect with the candidate, discuss issues impacting the neighborhood, and explore solutions centered on equity, inclusion, and growth in Brooklyn.

Impact:

Created a forum for authentic dialogue between the candidate and residents.

Helped increase campaign visibility and strengthen local support networks.

Contributed to building relationships that supported Cunninghamâ€™s continued leadership trajectory, culminating in his 2022 election to the New York State Assembly.
