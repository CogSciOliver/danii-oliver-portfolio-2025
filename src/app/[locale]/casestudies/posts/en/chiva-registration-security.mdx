# **UX Case Study: Optimizing Chi'Va's Registration Flow & Data Security**

## **Overview**
Chi'Va offers an intuitive registration and subscription process designed to guide users through two distinct sign-up journeys. However, **usability and security challenges** arose in handling **database type selection**, **user session persistence**, and **seamless redirection to Stripe Checkout**. Our objective was to **streamline user onboarding** while **enhancing data security** by preventing sensitive user information from being exposed in URLs.

---

## ** Problem Statement**
Chi'Va's registration flow had **two pathways**, but both contained usability and security issues:

### **1. selectReg Flow (Plan First &rarr; Register  &rarr; Checkout)**
**Expected Flow:**
1. User **selects a plan** on the pricing page.
2. User **is redirected to the register page** (`/register?price=planId`).
3. After registration, the user **is redirected to Stripe Checkout**.
4. After payment, the user **completes checkout and is redirected to the dashboard**.

**Issue:**
- User **was not always redirected to Stripe Checkout** after registration.
- The `registrationFlow` logic was inconsistent, causing unexpected loops.

---

### **2. regSelect Flow (Register First -> Plan -> Checkout)**
**Expected Flow:**
1. User **clicks "Sign Up"** on the login screen.
2. User **is redirected to the register page** (`/register`).
3. After registration, the user **is redirected to pricing** to select a plan.
4. User selects a plan and **is redirected to Stripe Checkout**.
5. After payment, the user **is redirected to the dashboard**.

**Issue:**
- After selecting a plan, the user was **redirected back to the register page instead of Stripe Checkout**.
- `registrationFlow` state was **not properly persisted**, causing **loops in navigation**.

---

## ** Solution 1: Streamlining the Registration Flow**
We refactored **how the app manages `registrationFlow`**, ensuring smooth redirection logic across both journeys.

### ** Fixes Implemented**
1. **Tracked `registrationFlow` in session (React Context) instead of relying on URL query params**.
2. **Ensured `setUser()` stores the correct `registrationFlow` during registration**.
3. **Updated the pricing page to recognize `registrationFlow` from session storage**.
4. **Properly redirected users to `/api/checkout?price=planId` instead of `/register`**.

**Now, both flows work seamlessly:**
| Flow | Step | Fixed Behavior |
|------|------|------------------|
| **selectReg** | User selects a plan | Redirects to `/register?price=planId` |
|  | User registers | Redirects to Stripe Checkout (`/api/checkout`) |
| **regSelect** | User registers first | Redirects to `/pricing` to select a plan |
|  | User selects a plan | Redirects to `/api/checkout?price=planId` |
|  | After successful checkout | Redirects to the **user's dashboard** |

---

## ** Solution 2: Enhancing Data Security**
Before our improvements, user **emails and sensitive session data were passed in URLs**, making them **vulnerable to exposure**.

### ** Security Issues Before Fixes**
- ‚ùå **`email` and `registrationFlow` were exposed in query params (`/pricing?email=user@example.com`).**
- ‚ùå **Plan selection passed `email` in URLs (`/api/checkout?price=planId&email=user@example.com`).**
- ‚ùå **User authentication details were not properly isolated between client-side and server-side logic.**

### ** Security Fixes Implemented**
1. **Stored user session details (`email`, `registrationFlow`) in React Context (`useUser()`).**
2. **Removed email from URL parameters, replacing it with session-based retrieval.**
3. **Ensured all sensitive data was only retrieved on the server via API calls (`getUserInfo()`).**
4. **Updated `getUser()` to fetch only necessary fields (e.g., `subscriptionStatus`), avoiding exposure of passwords or private IDs.**

---

## ** Final Outcome**
| Improvement |  Benefit |
|------------|------------|
| **Registration flow fixes** | Users are correctly redirected to Stripe Checkout without looping back to register. |
| **Secure session handling** | `useUser()` stores user session securely instead of relying on URL params. |
| **No exposed email in URLs** | Prevents leaking personal user data in browser history or logs. |
| **Database queries optimized** | Fetching only necessary fields improves security & performance. |

---

## **üéØ Key Takeaways**
1. **Always use session storage (React Context) for user details instead of URL query params.**
2. **Ensure registration flow logic is properly managed to avoid unnecessary redirects.**
3. **Use `getUser()` in a secure server action (`getUserInfo()`) instead of exposing email in the frontend.**
4. **Redirect users efficiently by maintaining `registrationFlow` state properly.**

**With these fixes, Chi'Va now has a secure, user-friendly onboarding experience.**  
 **New users can register, subscribe, and access their dashboard without errors or security risks.**   

---

### **Next Steps**
- Implement **user authentication tokens** for session persistence.
- Store additional security logs for **user session validation**.
- Optimize **checkout session recovery** in case of payment failures.

**Chi'Va's registration and payment experience is now both frictionless and secure.**
