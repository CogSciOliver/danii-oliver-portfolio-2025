A multi-layered approach to modernizing a legacy equity platform to meet the evolving needs of users and businesses looking secure future growth in the space of supporting stakeholders such as founders, HR, legal teams, and investors. My focus has been to integrating the latest and greatest technologies would help sail 20-30 years of expertise into the future. When it comes to older systems the fear of change is less about doing better, we all want that but more on the loss that will be experienced by the change.

I see my role, my team fit as being the bridge to listen to subject matter experts and help negotiate their longevity alongside the longevity of the business. Today that conversation is around AI. AI to automate decision-making, unify the platform experience across stakeholders, and position the product to retain and grow clients from early stages to exit.

We all want our customers to remain but in the world of technology, we are not Coke Cola, the product can not remain the same for a changing demographic. And with founders increasingly becoming solopreneurs it is essential that as a brand wanting their B2B business for the life of those companies we make things easier to manage in a manner that leads to success not stress.

## Overview

Opportunities exist to modernize UX coherence and layer AI-driven decision support, because financial and legal workflows are complex and multi-persona. Show how a cross-functional AI design leader can modernize an equity platform’s UX, embed intelligent guidance, and grow client lifespan from incorporation to public-market liquidity.

## Problem Landscape

UX breakdown: stakeholder-specific features often create inconsistent user flows and trust gaps.

AI opportunity: existing platforms underutilize the automation AI offers for data house population, insight extraction, compliance document building, error prevention, or user decision support.

Growth ceiling: hard to scale with clients past Series C without feeling outdated or rigid. White glove expectations vs self-service restrictions.

## Role & Vision

As a cross-functional AI and product strategist, I aim to:

-   Guide product, design, and engineering teams toward platform coherence.
-   Orchestrate design systems that scale across roles and company stages.
-   Lead AI product integrations that:
    -- Reduce founder & admin overhead (automated grant templates, investor Q&A, compliance reminders).
    -- Personalize user dashboards by stage and role.
    -- Predict risk or offer decision suggestions (e.g., “You’re issuing ISOs at the wrong FMV window.”)

## Approach and Framework

| Pillar                               | Focus                                       | Example                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1. Platform Coherence**            | Design system + IA overhaul                 | Map the entire equity issuance and board approval journey across roles               |
| **2. AI-Powered UX**                 | Contextual insights & next steps            | Auto-flag errors in grant creation or suggest board resolutions                      |
| **3. Stakeholder-Responsive Design** | Tailored UX for founders vs HR vs investors | Dynamic dashboards + progressive disclosure                                          |
| **4. Generational Fit**              | Lifecycle-aligned tools                     | Support startup-to-public workflows; preserve equity storytelling across generations |
| **5. Growth Alignment**              | Market fit across verticals                 | Build features that help companies stay post-IPO or post-acquisition                 |

## Methodology

## Business Impact and Outcomes

## Strategic Fit

## Why Now

-   New players like Mantle are combining AI and equity tooling from day one.
-   Incumbents risk feeling outdated or disjointed without design leadership + intelligent automation.
-   Clients now expect founder-friendly, compliance-safe, AI-supported workflows that evolve with them.

## Generational Vision

Position the platform as the long-term steward of ownership narratives—helping teams pass equity stories from founders to employees to IPO investors.

The next generation of equity tools won’t just manage shares—they’ll tell the story of ownership, effort, and scale. That means tools that guide users, not just track their actions. My role is to lead that evolution—with AI, with empathy, and with systems thinking that grows from startup roots to generational reach.
