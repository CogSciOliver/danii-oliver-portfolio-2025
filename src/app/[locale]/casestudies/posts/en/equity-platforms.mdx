A multi-layered approach to modernizing a legacy equity platform to meet the evolving needs of users and businesses looking secure future growth in the space of supporting stakeholders such as founders, HR, legal teams, and investors. My focus has been to integrating the latest and greatest technologies would help sail 20-30 years of expertise into the future. When it comes to older systems the fear of change is less about doing better, we all want that but more on the loss that will be experienced by the change.

I see my role, my team fit as being the bridge to listen to subject matter experts and help negotiate their longevity alongside the longevity of the business. Today that conversation is around AI. AI to automate decision-making, unify the platform experience across stakeholders, and position the product to retain and grow clients from early stages to exit.

We all want our customers to remain but in the world of technology, we are not Coke Cola, the product can not remain the same for a changing demographic. And with founders increasingly becoming solopreneurs it is essential that as a brand wanting their B2B business for the life of those companies we make things easier to manage in a manner that leads to success not stress.

## Overview 
Opportunities exist to modernize UX coherence and layer AI-driven decision support, because financial and legal workflows are complex and multi-persona. 

## Problem Landscape
UX breakdown: stakeholder-specific features often create inconsistent user flows and trust gaps.

AI opportunity: existing platforms underutilize the automation AI offers for data house population, insight extraction, compliance document building, error prevention, or user decision support.

Growth ceiling: hard to scale with clients past Series C without feeling outdated or rigid. White glove expectations vs self-service restrictions. 

## Role & Vision

As a cross-functional AI and product strategist, I aim to:

-   Guide product, design, and engineering teams toward platform coherence.
-   Orchestrate design systems that scale across roles and company stages.
-   Lead AI product integrations that:
    -- Reduce founder & admin overhead (automated grant templates, investor Q&A, compliance reminders).
    -- Personalize user dashboards by stage and role.
    -- Predict risk or offer decision suggestions (e.g., “You’re issuing ISOs at the wrong FMV window.”)
