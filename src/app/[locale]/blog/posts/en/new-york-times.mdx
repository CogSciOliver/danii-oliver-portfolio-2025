## **Overview** 
Lead UX Engineer at The New York Times, I spearheaded the development of a mobile-first user interface for the subscription eCommerce platform. Recognizing the increasing trend of mobile device usage among our audience, I advocated for a design approach that prioritized mobile user experience to enhance engagement and reduce bounce rates.

## **Objective:**

The primary goal was to redesign the subscription eCommerce platform with a mobile-first approach, ensuring accessibility and usability across all devices. This initiative aimed to improve user satisfaction, increase subscription conversions, and future-proof the platform against the rapidly growing mobile user base.

## **Key Contributions:**

- **Advocacy for Mobile-First Design:** Conducted user research and data analysis to highlight the necessity of a mobile-friendly interface, presenting findings to management to support the strategic shift.

- **Prototype Development:** Utilized downtime to code a high-fidelity mobile prototype, demonstrating the potential benefits of responsive design and improved user interaction.

- **User Research and Data Analysis:** Analyzed user data, including email opens and site visit analytics, to identify the growing trend of mobile device usage and its impact on user engagement.

- **Stakeholder Communication:** Engaged with management to present data-driven insights and advocate for the adoption of mobile-first design principles, emphasizing the long-term benefits for user experience and business outcomes.

## **Challenges and Strategic Solutions:**

1. **Management Resistance to Change:**  
   - *Challenge:* Despite clear data indicating a shift towards mobile usage, management was hesitant to deviate from traditional design paradigms.  
   - *Solution:* Developed a functional mobile prototype to tangibly demonstrate the advantages of a mobile-first approach, facilitating informed discussions.

2. **Limited Resources for Full Redesign:**  
   - *Challenge:* Time constraints and resource allocation limited the ability to conduct comprehensive wireframing and mockups.  
   - *Solution:* Leveraged available time to create a working prototype, effectively communicating design concepts and potential improvements.

3. **User Experience Challenges on Mobile Devices:**  
   - *Challenge:* Users reported frustrations with visibility, the necessity for pinch-zoom interactions, and slow loading times due to unoptimized images.  
   - *Solution:* Proposed dynamic UI/UX design enhancements using CSS and JavaScript to realign elements for better visibility and interaction on mobile devices.

## **Business Impact and Outcomes:**

- **Enhanced User Awareness:** The prototype and advocacy efforts raised awareness among stakeholders about the importance of mobile-first design, setting the stage for future enhancements.

- **Incremental Improvements:** Achieved a compromise that led to minimal mobile display alterations, slightly improving user experience on mobile devices.

- **Foundation for Future Development:** The initiative highlighted critical areas for improvement, influencing subsequent design considerations and fostering a more user-centric approach in future projects.

This experience underscored the importance of data-driven decision-making, user advocacy, and strategic communication with stakeholdersâ€”skills that are essential in a leadership role.
